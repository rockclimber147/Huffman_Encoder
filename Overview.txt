WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES, STEP BY STEP

1. Get the character frequencies from a file (lookups.c)
2. With those frequencies, encapsulate the character in a TreeNode and put that in a QueueNode along with the frequency
    2a. Enqueue the node
    2b. repeat for all the characters with nonzero frequencies
3. while the Queue has a length > 1:
    deQueue into left
    deQueue into right
    make a new QueueNode with:
        a new Tree with left = root node from left, right = root node from right
        sum of left and right priorities
    enQueue the new node
4. Grab the complete tree from the final QueueNode
5. generate the codetable from the tree
6. use the input file characters to write the code words to a new file
